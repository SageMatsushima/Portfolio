                    ​During my freshman fall semester at Brown, my Intro to Computer Science class assigned us a project
                    that utilized timelines in Eclipse and animation. As a result, we had to code the popular game
                    Tetris along with its rules: when a row is filled clear it, the game is over when you reach the top,
                    etc. This project helped me understand the implementation and use of timelines in computer science
                    as well as using cases in Java to create the rules and shapes of the game.

        <p class="ending">
            This project really tested my Java skills through implementation of the timeline feature in Eclipse and
            creating visual elements in a code. Overall, it deepened my understanding of the limits of Java and showed
            me how enjoyable coding can be for games and design. Because of this, I decided to look further into design
            and the creation of game development.
