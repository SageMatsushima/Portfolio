            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>During my freshman fall semester at Brown, my Intro to Computer Science class assigned us a final that
                utilized all of the past projects to make a game called Othello. In this game, two users face off using
                circular tiles that flip based on turns. In my program, we had to implement the graphic system as well
                as create an AI program that could compete in three different difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
            This project really tested my Java skills through implementation of the AI and its difficulties. Having the
            computer calculate for each move and calculate the "score" for each move was extremely difficult. However,
            once the AI was completed the game is really easy and fun to play. I also ended up becoming very good at the
            game itself and was even able to best the AI program in one game. Overall, I think it was a great project
            that expanded my understanding of AI and the use of Java as a program as well.
