            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>During my freshman spring semester at Brown, my Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures class assigned us
                a project that had us implement a priority queue based on the heap data structure, but note that various
                forms of priority queues are common throughout society. It had us code a linked binary tree filled with
                left completeness and could add, remove, and adjust the tree at any given moment.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
            Heap was a difficult project for me in various ways. First off, it was hard to connect the concept of
            priority queues with code. Although I understood the basic concept, the implementation of the algorithm
            itself was difficult to grasp. Furthermore, it was hard to make the linked binary tree left complete and
            keep it that way. For instance, when you remove a node, you have to make sure that the tree remains left
            complete; therefore you have to calculate the values for each node several times. Overall I found that
            although this project was difficult, it also enlightened me to the reality of the world and its priority
            queue implementations. A major example is the US Government’s system to process visas and green cards and
            how they prioritize cases. This is just one example of the prevalence of this type of data structure and the
            importance of them in the real world.
