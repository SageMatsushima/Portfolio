    <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <div id="overview">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p class="over">
          The iterative design project is an assignment from Brown’s CS1300 course, focused particularly on
          <mark>iterative
            design, prototyping, and usability testing</mark>. Working in a team of two, we created and iterated on
          designs for
          the UI of a start-up, conducting critque sessions and user usability testing to gain feedback and improve
          upon each iteration.</p>

        <h3>The Start-Up</h3>
        <p>The start-up our team chose to focus on is <mark><a style="color: #632CFF; text-decoration: none;"
              href="https://piepacker.com/">PiePacker</a></mark>, a free online gaming platform to hangout and play
          premium
          retro
          games with friends online. The user is presented with a collection of original multiplayer games, which they
          can play in ‘rooms’ similarly to a screen sharing in a Zoom Call. In our case, we chose to design a website
          interface.</p>

      <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <h3>Users</h3>
      <p>
        The user who we designed the webpage for are individuals who enjoy computer games and
        playing these games with friends in a more casual environment. It's aimed towards users who are looking to play
        games and socially interact others. We also assumed that our users are not necessarily "tech-savvy". Because of
        this, we wanted our user experience to be as <mark>intuitive and easy-to-learn</mark> as possible, especially
        for first-time users.<br>
        <br>
        PiePacker’s goal is to create a fun and social environment for individuals to collaborate and
        compete in online games, which we chose our user as an individual who is a casual gamer, social, and not
        necessarily super tech-savvy.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div>
      <h3 id="ske">Low-Fidelity Sketches</h3>
      <p>To start off our design process, we were to create four low-fidelity sketches of our webpage.
        However,
        before we could do so, we first identified the inital <mark>key pages to design: the home page, game search,
          login/signup, game room, game results, and settings.</mark>
      </p>
      <div id="sketches">
        <img class="sketch" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch1.png">
        <img class="sketch" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch2.png">
        <img class="sketch" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch2.png">
        <img class="sketch" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch3.jpg">
        <img class="sketch" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch4.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>From our initial sketches, we identified the components and designs we liked the
        most, combining them into our mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Mid-Fidelity WireFrames</h3>
      <p>
        Based on our initial sketches, we created mid fidelity wireframes of our designs using
        <mark>Figma.</mark>
      </p>
      <img id="mid" src="Iterative Design Images/MidWFs.png" />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="styleguide">Style Guide</h3>
      <p>Before creating our High Fidelity Prototypes, we made a visual style guide to <mark>maintain consistency</mark>
        and
        resuable UI components across our designs.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
      <p>For our high-fidelity interactive prototypes, we made three iterations. The first iteration we
        took into a
        critique studio. After iterating upon the feedback recieved from that critique to make our second iteration,
        we conducted usability testing. With the usability testing feedback, we were able to improve our designs
        even
        more, resulting in our third and most recent iteration.<br>
        The third iteration is presented below.</p>
      <div style="flex-direction: column; margin-top: -1%;">

    <div>
      <h3 id="userfeed">User Feedback</h3>
      <p>In our studio critique, we had classmates and a UX researcher from Nintendo interact with our prototype,
        and gained their feedback. From the session, the most helpful and common feedback points were:</p>
      <div id="feed">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume users have never seen or used this platform before. The key is to create a site that is very
              <mark>intuitive and learnable.</mark>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Simplify the Navigation bar so that navigating between pages is less confusing: <br><mark>Home, Search,
                Messages, Account Settings</mark>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The Leave Game overlay is very confusing. People did not know how to get back to the home page from the
              game room from the leave button because of the Leave Game overlay.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>User Tesing</h3>
      <p>With our second iteration, we conducted <mark>usability testing</mark> with three random individuals through
        UserTesting.com. The link to the three user test videos can be found <mark><a
            href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15j8eVvRhsB7u_LNox1m8FX0yd86n_FW1?usp=sharing">here</a>.</mark>
      </p>

      <p>
        For our usability testing, we had the users complete a series of sub-tasks to create and enter a game
        room:<br>
      <p id="tasks">1. Create an Account<br>
        2. Choose a game from favorite games list<br>
        3. Create a room<br>
        4. Join a game<br>
        5. Look at game Chat<br>
        6. Leave Game and Return to Home<br>
        7. Look at your chat notifications and open up the most recent conversation<br>
        8. Go to Account Settings and log out<br></p>

      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="responsebox">
          <h4><mark>User A</mark></h4>
          <p class="feedback">Time to complete: ~4:00 min <br>
            <b>“Really nothing [was confusing]. Tasks were very easy
              as
              if it were a site I was familiar with”</b><br> <br>
            User A was able to complete the tasks with ease, and found the site both straightforward and intuitive.
            They also said they liked the purple and gray color scheme.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="responsebox">
          <h4><mark style="background-color: #f7a88d;">User B </mark></h4>
          <p class="feedback">Time to complete: ~9:00 min<br>
            <b>“I had a hard time finding home and basically back
              tracking through anything.”
            </b><br> <br>
            During User B’s test, they were confused by Figma’s prototype and accidently ended up signing up for
            Figma. They ran into issues with going back home, although for the rest of the prototype they said it
            was
            fairly intuitive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="responsebox">
          <h4><mark style="background-color: #f1764d;">User C</mark></h4>
          <p class="feedback">Time to complete: ~3:30 min<br>
            <b>“The layout of the site was very basic and did not
              look
              professional.”
            </b><br> <br>
            User C was able to complete tasks relatively easily. However, when creating a room, they ran into an
            issue where they were unable to close the overlay, and had the restart. They also recommended making the
            appearance more professional.</p>
        </div>
      </div><br>
      <p>The results showed the usability and intuitiveness of our design backed up by the positive user
        feedback. Users B and
        C ran into
        issues with closing out the overlays, but this was an error on our team’s end; we did not connect
        the prototype correctly (accidently selected ‘navigate to’ instead of ‘swap with’ for the overlays). We also
        did not link the back button on the game information page, another design error on our end.
        <br><br>
        Using the feedback we recieved, we corrected the prototyping errors that users experienced. If given more
        time, we would definitely continue to refine the appearance of the website, making it more professional and
        making components more compact.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
      <p class="ending">
        Throughout this project, our biggest takeaway was <mark>the experience we gained conducting usability
          testing</mark>
        through a professional site like Usertesting.com, as well as how to structure usability tests to best
        gauge
        results. Subtasks gave the users enough direction to move through the site, but also
        left room for them to figure things out on their own and see what issues they experienced.
        <br><br>
        The <mark>Nintendo UX Researcher</mark> told
        us that our start-up interface was one that was relatively new, which gave us much more freedom to explore and
        try
        things out. As a result, we had much more space for creativity. However, because
        iof this, the key question was: how we could make our users understand how
        to use the site. In other words, <mark>when dealing with new and innovative ideas, having intuitive and
          understandable
          interfaces is key to maintaining usability and minimizing confusion.</mark>
