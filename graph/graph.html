                <p id="over">
                    ​During my freshman spring semester at Brown, my Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures class
                    assigned us a final project that had us use all of the information throughout the course to make a
                    Graph.
                    This data structure had us <mark>implement a graph using an adjacency matrix</mark> as its
                    underlying data
                    structure. We also implemented the <mark>Prim-Jarnik algorithm </mark>for finding minimum spanning
                    forests (MSFs)
                    and the <mark>PageRank algorithm</mark> to find which node/"page" was the most important. When
                    clicking
                    "PageRank", the nodes expand or contract according to their rank.

            Graph was an especially hard project due to COVID and the transition to at home learning. As a result, it
            was harder to obtain information and help from TAs. That being said, it was a very fulfilling project;
            Pagerank was something that was fun to explore. Its implementations in society, such as its <mark>use for
                search
                engines</mark> like Google, is seen everywhere and used in almost every website's search bars. This
            calculation of
            importance helps quickly direct the user to the best websites and the most popular ones as well. As a
            result, the user is more inclined to visit the search engine more due to its efficiency and reliability.
