                <p id="over">
                    During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project that would better
                    help us understand <mark>AB testing,</mark> its applications, and then implementing it into our own
                    websites. We
                    then had to make two webpages that differentiated between user interfaces to see the
                    <mark>statistical difference</mark> between both.

            <div>
                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    Before I ran my program, I had first make two null and two alternative hypotheses: <mark>1. Time to
                        Completion</mark>, and <mark>2. Return Rate.</mark>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="sub">Null</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is no difference between the two websites in the time that it takes to complete a task
                    </li>
                    <li>There is no difference between the two websites in return rates back to the home screen</li>
                </ol>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3 class="sub">Alternative</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Website A will have a faster time to completion than website B because it is more minimalistic
                        and there are less distractions in the way of the user</li><br>
                    <li>Users will return to website B more often than website A because of its aesthetic purposes and
                        layout
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                First, I created two different interfaces that varied in presentation but had an interface close enough
                to
                compare to each other. Then, 25 classmates acted as users and randomly accessed either design A or B.
                Their
                task
                was to purchase $150 worth of cacti and to checkout. The user information was then recorded and stored.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="infographic">Infographic</h3>
            <div class="info">
                <img src="info.png" class="graphic" alt="Infographic" />
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    After calculating the T and Chi Squared values, using both p values, it statistically determined
                    that <mark>the hypothesis is insignificant.</mark> This means that there is doubt that the
                    alternative hypotheses
                    will repeat itself in other trials. As a result, the null might be correct since there isn't enough
                    poof that the alternate hypotheses are true.
                </p>

                Although the the results reflected in this project are from statistics of 25 users, this sample space
                was
                limited to my fellow students and had a limit to the amount of people able to access the webpages. The
                results
                of this project shows how AB testing helps developers <mark>gain a better insight on their own designs
                    from real user's data.</mark> Sometimes it is better to make your website more accessible than
                interactive.
                Clearer and straightforward minimalistic designs help users navigate quicker and simple aesthetics make
                them want to come back.
