            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>During my freshman spring semester at Brown, my Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures class assigned us
                a project that had us calculate the least important pixels in an image. By calculating the least
                important pixels, we could then create a "seam" of unimportant pixels and remove them from the image.
                This is an easy way to resize a picture keeping the most "important" pixels within it. Pixels that are
                very different from their neighbors should have high importance, and pixels that are similar in color to
                their neighbors should have low importance. As a result, the image ends up keeping the significant color
                changes and discarding similar pixels to save space.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
            Seamcarve really opened my eyes to the beginnings of image manipulation and distortion. Even through the
            calculations and algorithms used for this program were fairly simple, you can clearly see the major impact
            that it has on an image and its outcome. Overall, it helped me question the question behind images and their
            reliability; if I could code a simple program that took out "unimportant" pixels with little disturbance,
            what can other computer science engineers do with images that I am unaware of?
