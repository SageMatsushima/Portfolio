                    During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project: pick a
                    website that was accessible to the public but could be <mark>redesigned to increase
                        usability.</mark></p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <h3>Useability</h3>
            <p class="use">
                The website has no cohesive layout; the important information is scattered
                throughout the page in
                random dividers varying in size. The navigation bar is also confusing because it's not in a traditional
                places usually seen in websites. Additionally, the footer is missing the "menu" link and
                doesn't have
                all the components in the navigation bar. <br>
                <br>The photos are unappealing, the font is too small and has some inconsistent spacing.
                Overall, it feels dated and the layout of the buttons and the pictures makes the website hard to
                use and navigate.
            </p>

            <h3>Learnability</h3>
            <p class="learn">
                This website is incredibly hard to learn. The small buttons in the lower right hand corners
                are really
                hard to even see. Plus, the hit boxes are only set to be
                the
                small buttons so the user has to learn that they can't just click the picture itself. These small
                inconsistent details make the website confusing and unappealing.
            </p>

            <h3>Memorability</h3>
            <p class="mem">
                There is nothing either interface-wise or even graphic-wise that
                stands out or makes the user want to come back to the site more than once. In fact, the website
                actually makes the café more unappealing and unappetizing due to the crude pictures and the
                disregard
                for
                the
                appearance. This can potentially hurt business sales due to the first impressions and make
                the
                restaurant
                feel as if they don't care.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub">Accessibility</h3>
            <p class="acc">
                Using <mark><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" class="link" target="_blank"
                        style="text-decoration: none;">WebAIM WAVE</a></mark>, the
                program detected multiple errors both in the code and structural issues. There are 8
                redundant
                links to the menu,no alternative text for users that see the pictures on their
                computer, and text that
                was
                barely visible due to poor contrast between the two colors. Because of these factors, I
                believe that the
                website could be redesigned to better optimize the structure and information on the page to help
                user
                accessibility.

                    <p>
                        I completely redesigned the layout of the website to make it more streamlined and
                        readable for users. I added a navigation bar in
                        the header with clear access to the menu and the information about the website. I then wanted to
                        make sure the pictures of the food were easily seen and more appealing by putting them right
                        below the nav bar.
                        <br> <br>
                        I increased the spacing of the dividers to show where the most important
                        information
                        is. Lastly, I made a footer at the bottom of the page to quickly access other
                        media outlets
                        for users to find out reviews for the cafe.
                    </p>

        <h3 class="t">Tablet</h3>
        <div class="twf">
            <div class="timage">
                <img src="both.png" class="both" alt="tablet wireframe" />
            </div>
            <div class="ptext">
                <p>
                    Like the desktop version, I kept the same properties and layout for: the pictures below the nav
                    bar, important information below, and the footer and its
                    social media elements. <br><br>
                    I decided to make a dropdown menu to condense the navigation bar, keeping the font large
                    enough
                    for the user.
                    I also changed the description part to better fit a smaller, more narrow screen;
                    due to the nature of touch screen technology, the user can just scroll down instead of reading
                    side-to-side.
                </p>
                <h3 class="p">Phone</h3>
                <p>
                    The phone display is the same as the tablet version except with modified font size and grid template
                    size to accommodate for the user's phone.

                <p>
                    Using my lo-fi sketches, I translated it into HTML and CSS to create a new, more refined website for
                    the
                    cafe.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="d">Desktop</h3>
            <div class="dwf">

                    <img src="desktop.jpg" class="dhfi" alt="desktop hifi mockup" />

                <div class="ddtext">
                    <p class="ttext">
                        For my hi-fi desktop mockup, I made an interactable navigation bar that links to the respective
                        sites on he original website. The picture rotates every 5 seconds to a new photo of the food
                        served at the location and can be clicked on to go to the menu. <br>
                        <br>
                        Below the break line, the important information is easily readable and the location and the map
                        both link to google maps. The footer follows the user's scroll so
                        they can easily access the social media or yelp page for reviews.
                    </p>

            <h3 class="t">Tablet</h3>
            <div class="twf">
                <div class="timage">
                    <img src="bboth.png" class="both" alt="tablet hifi mockup" />

                    <p class="ttext">
                        Similar to my lo-fi mockups, I replaced the straight menu with a dropdown menu to save space on
                        the smaller screens. Once clicked, the hamburger icon on the left creates the original menu
                        without the name of the Cafe. I also made the story description more linear
                        and adjusted the font size and the grid sizes. <br><br>
                        I also made the interface more interactive with hover response and direct links from the images
                        to the sub-pages or websites associated.
                    </p>

                        The phone display is the same as the tablet version except with modified font size and grid
                        template
                        size to accommodate for the user's phone. Again, more streamlined and linear design which
                        creates a
                        better experience while swiping up.

            <h2>Style guide</h2>
            <p class="over">
                For my website, I chose to have a unifying style guide that helped bring all the elements together:
            <div id="style">
                <img src="style-guide.jpg" class="style-guide" alt="style-guide" />
            </div>
            <p id="q">
                Last but not least, the responsiveness of my website is quite simple; once the width of the page gets to
                a
                certain pixel size, the fonts, pictures, navigation, and buttons all either increase or decrease in size
                /
                change formats entirely to fit the proffered screen.</p>

            <p class="ending">
                From this project, I have learned that streamlined designs for websites with clear and recognizable
                features can help the user understand the company as a whole. If websites are cluttered and confusing,
                users first impression can hinder sales or costumer satisfaction. <mark>The better a webpage is, the
                    longer
                    the user will stay on and read what you say</mark>. An enjoyable, clear interface will help the user
                gather the
                necessary information they want and come back when they need to.
