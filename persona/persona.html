				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>​During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project that made us pick
					an
					interface that was accessible but flawed. Using users feedback, we then had to make personas and
					storyboards centered around the users and their experiences. By doing so, it creates a better
					understanding of users and their own experiences interacting with interfaces. <br><br>

					Due to COVID, interface selection was limited and therefore users were based on my family members
					within
					my household. As a result, I chose my family's washing machine.</p>

			<h3>Today's interface: Washing machine</h3>

					<p>
						This interface lets the user choose what type of wash they want their clothes to have. Each wash
						cycle can be extremely specific: you can change the spin speed, temperature, or the amount of
						water. It then takes the inputs and customizes the wash for your clothes.

			<h3 class="Research">Research</h3>
			<h3>Observations</h3>
			<p>
				All users took time to read the labels for the dial, although varying from skimming to taking a moment
				to
				read
				all of
				them, and all took brief moments to step back to look at the machine as a whole. Furthermore, most users
				paused
				at the
				control panel and hesitated while inputting the setting using the buttons. <br />
				<br />
				First time users became increasingly frustrated as they kept reading the additional options and buttons,
				while
				users
				who have experienced the machine were less affected by the options and skimmed through them quickly.
				Some
				common
				phrases heard from users was: “What does this mean?”, “ummmm”, and “am I doing this right?”.
			</p>

		<div class="interview" style="background-color: rebeccapurple;">
			<h3>Interview Questions:</h3>
			<ol class="list">
				<li>What buttons do you see?</li>
				<li>Do you know what each option does?</li>
				<li>Explain your process when picking options from the dial and the grid.</li>
				<li>What surprised you, if anything, when picking your type of wash?</li>
				<li>Do the labels help or confuse you when picking washing options?</li>
				<br />
			</ol>
			<p>

				Most users found that although there were a plethora of tools and buttons available, the main issue with
				the
				overall interface was how confusing and how little information it provided about the influence each
				option
				had on the clothes. Furthermore, the differences in options was confusing, especially the control panel;
				users didn't know how to control the main 4 buttons and had no/little understanding of the 8 side
				options at
				all. In fact, even the most advanced user didn't understand all the buttons and options for the dial. 
				​<br />
				<br />
				Although some of the labels helped with choosing the type of was for each fabric, there were just too
				many
				sub-options for each label. The results from the interview questions posted were from 3 main types of
				users:
				one who uses the machine on a weekly basis, one who is familiar with the machine but barely uses it, and
				one
				who has seen the machine twice. As a result, I felt as if the answers were fairly balanced; however
				there is
				bias based on the fact that all users have previously seen the machine before.

		<h3>Personas</h3>
		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Wendy</h4>

			<div>
				<img src="Personas1.jpg" class="image2" alt="Empathy map of Working Wendy" />
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					The user is a mother of 4 children who uses the washing machine on a regular basis. They are used to
					the
					options
					and therefore rarely get frustrated; they know the exact button to use for each type of clothes and
					which to avoid
					entirely.<br />
					<br />

					This mother admitted that although she knows which options to choose for certain clothes, there are
					just
					way too
					many and most remain unused. In fact, she states that even she doesn’t know what most of the
					functions
					do and will
					stick to the options that are understood easier. <br />
					<br />
					This mother represents the users that are familiar to the machine and its options yet still confused
					about the
					excessive options and their functions. However, these users still accept that they will never
					understand
					and
					proceed to do their daily jobs.

		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Bewildered Brian</h4>
		<div class="imagebox">
			<div>
				<img src="Personas2.jpg" class="image3" alt="Empathy map of Bewildered Brian" />
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					This user is a new college grad coming back from school. The user is not new to the washing machine
					but is rather unfamiliar with all of its components and the model itself. They are unsure of each
					button pressed and the consequences/outcomes of each option.<br />
					<br />
					the user is a fairly new user puzzled by the machine and its options. He is unsure about almost all
					his
					decisions
					and questions if he has inputted the correct options for his wash. In the end, he gets increasingly
					frustrated with
					his confusion which pushes him to give up.
					<br />
					<br />
					This user represents the users unfamiliar with the functions of the machine and its choices. As a
					result, the users
					will typically walk away in frustration or start the machine to end the confusion.

			<h3>Takeaways</h3>
			<p>
				From this project, I have learned that over-complicating interfaces with every option can confuse users
				and
				distract them from their initial task. Interfaces should be a <mark>streamlined design</mark> that helps
				the
				user <mark>quickly access information</mark> without confusion from a quick scan. Additionally, I have
				learned
				how to effectively collect data and turn it into useful information about the users and their
				interactions
				with
				interfaces.
