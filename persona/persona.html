				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>​During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project that made us
					<mark>pick
						an
						interface that was accessible but flawed</mark>. Using users feedback, we then had to make
					personas and
					storyboards centered around the users and their experiences. By doing so, it creates a better
					understanding of users and their own experiences interacting with interfaces. <br><br>

					<i>Due to <mark>COVID</mark>, interface selection was limited and therefore users were based on my
						family members
						within
						my household. As a result, I chose <mark>my family's washing machine.</mark>
					</i>

				<p>
					This interface lets the user choose what type of wash they want their clothes to have. Each wash
					cycle can be extremely specific: you can change the spin speed, temperature, or the amount of
					water. It then takes the inputs and customizes the wash for your clothes.
				</p>

			<h3 class="Research">Research</h3>
			<h3>Observations</h3>
			<p>
				All users took time to read the labels for the dial, although varying from skimming to taking a moment
				to read all of them, and all took brief moments to step back to look at the machine as a whole.
				Furthermore, most users paused at the control panel and hesitated while inputting the setting using the
				buttons.
				<br />
				<br />
				<mark>First time users became increasingly frustrated</mark> as they kept reading the additional options
				and buttons,
				while users who have experienced the machine were less affected by the options and skimmed through them
				quickly. Some common phrases heard from users was: <mark>“What does this mean?”, “ummmm”, and “am I
					doing this
					right?”.</mark>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="interview">
			<h3>Interview Questions:</h3>
			<ol class="list">
				<li>What buttons do you see?</li>
				<li>Do you know what each option does?</li>
				<li>Explain your process when picking options from the dial and the grid.</li>
				<li>What surprised you, if anything, when picking your type of wash?</li>
				<li>Do the labels help or confuse you when picking washing options?</li>
				<br />
			</ol>
			<p>

				Most users found that the main issue with
				the overall interface was how confusing and how little information it provided about the influence each
				option had on the clothes. The differences in options were confusing, especially the control
				panel; <mark>users didn't know how to control the main 4 buttons</mark> and had little to no
				understanding of the 8
				side
				options at all. In fact, even the most advanced user didn't understand all the buttons and options for
				the dial. ​
				​<br />
				<br />
				The results from the interview questions posted were from 3 main types of
				users:
				one who uses the machine on a weekly basis, one who is familiar with the machine but barely uses it, and
				one
				who has seen the machine twice. As a result, I felt as if the answers were fairly balanced; however
				there is
				bias based on the fact that all users have previously seen the machine before.

		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Wendy</h4>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					The user is a mother of 4 children who uses the washing machine on a regular basis. They are used to
					the
					options
					and therefore rarely get frustrated; they know the exact button to use for each type of clothes and
					which to avoid
					entirely.<br />
					<br />

					This mother admitted that although she knows which options to choose for certain clothes, there are
					just
					way too
					many and most remain unused. In fact, she states that even she doesn’t know what most of the
					functions
					do and will
					stick to the options that are understood easier. <br />

		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Bewildered Brian</h4>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					This user is a new college grad coming back from school. The user is not new to the washing machine
					but is rather unfamiliar with all of its components and the model itself. They are unsure of each
					button pressed and the consequences/outcomes of each option.<br />
					<br />
					the user is a fairly new user puzzled by the machine and its options. He is unsure about almost all
					his
					decisions
					and questions if he has inputted the correct options for his wash. In the end, he gets increasingly
					frustrated with
					his confusion which pushes him to give up.

			<div id="takeaway">
				<h3>Takeaways</h3>
				<p>
					From this project, I have learned that over-complicating interfaces with every option can confuse
					users
					and
					distract them from their initial task. Interfaces should be a <mark>streamlined design</mark> that
					helps
					the
					user <mark>quickly access information</mark> without confusion from a quick scan. Additionally, I
					have
					learned
					how to effectively collect data and turn it into useful information about the users and their
					interactions
					with
					interfaces.
